# Software Application

Software applications are programs designed for end-users to perform specific tasks. These applications are a subset of software and come in different types: desktop applications, mobile applications, and web applications. Examples include HEC-RAS software, Instagram, and the National Map Viewer. To classify a record as a software application, `"@type: "SoftwareApplication"` should be used in the json schema. Records classifed as `SoftwareApplication` should be described using the [core metadata](https://github.com/I-GUIDE/data-catalog/blob/main/schema/core.md), as well as the software application specific properties for the [Schema:SoftwareApplication](https://schema.org/SoftwareApplication) class. The following table outlines the required and optional properties selected from Schema.Org vocabulary to design the software application metadata schema. These properties are encoded as `1` or `1+` for **required** and `0,1` or `0+` for **optional** in the Cardinality column of the table below. 

|Property|Class|Expected Type|Cardinality|Description|
